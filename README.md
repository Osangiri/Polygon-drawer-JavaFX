# Polygon drawer
For my graphic user interface program, I use a lot of references to the temperature converter. I also did a lot of research on the Java API. I was not familiar with most of the stuff in the graphic user interface, but I tried to understand every single thing I used in my program. I did  a couple of  Chat GPT searches, Google searches, and YouTube to which I attached the links citations that I used. So my program is a Polygon drawer. Inside the Polygon drawer is a drawing pane. The user can draw the Polygon in the drawing pane, and it gives the user an error every time the Polygon radius is going to be bigger than the drawing pane. There are also error messages if the radius is less than 0 or the size is less than three and also when a user inputs non-numeric values.
This is how the screen display comes out, I set it to (600, 600)
I added a title "Polygon Drawer" and for a favicon, I used a copyright-free image from Google

Inside the stage is a drawing pane that is (500,500) and starts at 250 from the top, It has a soft blue color, (Alice blue)

The largest radius a user can put is 250 which is equal to half the drawing pane.

Gives a warm error when the radius goes beyond 250 when the number of sides is less than 3, and also when the radius is negative

Gives a warning error in red when the input is not numbers and the number of sides is a floating point like 4.5 sides

The color picker is really helpful as the user can choose from a variety and even make a custom

I've learned that every single thing on a Graphic User Interface is a set of code. I spent a lot of time on this code, I had to run some code separately several times to see their functionality and debug, This was a great way to familiarise myself with Graphic user Interface.
